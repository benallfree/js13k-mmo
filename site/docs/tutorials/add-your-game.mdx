# Add Your Game to the Lab 13 Lobby

Join a growing online community ecosystem of tiny Online MMO games. Adding your game to the lobby makes it easy for players to discover and play your creation directly on the site.

Your game can optionally announce player presence to the lobby as well. This will show the current player count for your game in the lobby.

## Create a Pull Request

- Put your built static files at: `site/static/games/<your-slug>`
- Minimally, include an `index.html` entry point

Example structure:

```text
site/static/games/cats/
  index.html
  assets/
    bundle.js
    styles.css
```

### Optional Steps

#### Add a thumbnail

- Take a square screenshot (recommended 512×512) of your game
- Save it as `thumbnail.webp` next to your `index.html`
- Path: `site/static/games/<your-slug>/thumbnail.webp`
- If missing, the lobby will use `/img/favicon.webp` as a fallback

#### Add `meta.json`

Add metadata to improve the lobby card and game page.

Create `site/static/games/<your-slug>/meta.json`:

```json
{
  "title": "Black Cats",
  "description": "Chase mice with black cats in a spooky environment.",
  "repository": "https://github.com/your/repo"
}
```

> Note: if `meta.json` is omitted, the lobby will title‑case your folder name and leave description blank

### Open a PR

Submit a pull request to the repository: [benallfree/js13k](https://github.com/benallfree/js13k).

Include your `site/static/games/<your-slug>` folder.

That's it! Once merged, your game will appear in the lobby.

## Presence

Presence is automatic. When your game connects to its room using `Js13kClient`, the lobby will show the current player count for that room. No extra code is required.
