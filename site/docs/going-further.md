# Going Further

As you continue developing your MMO games, you are not limited to using JS13K's MMO server - you can run your own! See the [JS13K MMO repo](https://github.com/benallfree/js13k-mmo) to learn how to run and customize your own MMO server.

Happy coding everyone! Let's have a great jam.
